# FFT-in-C-plus-plus
Performs the FFT in C++

## Algorithm
This is a nieve implementation for the FFT without the speed inhancement from bitwise reversal.
The program will run in N lg2 N time where N is the amount of coefficients operated on

## Usage
See main.cpp for example code. The txt files in this repository are test cases.
